The following software is optional 

- [Git](git-scm.com) (for cloning this repo)

## Getting Started

To get started, run the following commands

1. `git clone https://github.com/aaron2212/react-starter-no-mock-api`
2. `cd react-starter-no-mock-api`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn start`

### Scripts

The following scripts are available to use and are the same ones as generated by `create-react-app`

    start - starts the development server
    test  - runs all unit tests
    build - creates a production build of the React application
    eject - ejects the project

### Included packages

This project includes extra packages that are useful when starting a new React application, but are not included in the initial `create-react-app` project.

- `formik` - every web application uses forms. `formik` simplifies the process of working with HTML forms
- `react-router-dom` - the starter project comes with routing set up
- `styled-components` - allows for styling HTML elements without the need for external stylesheets
- `yup` - this package goes hand-in-hand with `formik` to provide a validation schema for HTML forms

If you don't want to use any of these packages, you can do `yarn remove <package-name>` to remove it.

### Additional packages that could be useful

- Font Awesome

  ```
  yarn add @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
  yarn add @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
  yarn add @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
  ```

- Bootstrap

  ```
  yarn add react-bootstrap
  ```

- Moment
  ```
  yarn add moment
  ```

### Additional features

- An API service and HTTP client for making API calls to a backend server
- Helper classes for storing and retrieving JWT tokens
- A user authentication helper class to determine the state of the user
- A constants file `const.js` for storing constants used throughout the application
- A theme file `theme.js` for theming

## Coding style

This project is only a starter project and doesn't enforce any coding conventions or coding styles upon the developer. However, if you do want to follow the coding styles used in this project, they are as follows

### Components
- All components live under `src/components`, and their file name is joined by a dash wherever there would normally be a space between words
- All components are functional components instead of class based components
- All components are named exports and not default exports, with the exception of the root component `App`, and the name of the component is the same as the name of the file, but written in Upper Camel Case (also known as PascalCase)
- Components that are used in more than one place live under `src/components/shared` 

### Project structure
- All API related code lives under `src/api`
- All helper classes and methods live under `src/helpers`
- All utility classes and methods lives under `src/utils`
- All constants used throughout the application are stored in `const.js`
- All theming variables are stored in `theme.js`

### General coding style
- Single quotes should be used instead of double quotes, except for HTML attributes, in which case double quotes are preferred
- The last item in an array of objects or the last key in an object should end with a `,`, for example
```javascript
    const links = [
        { href: 'https://google.com', text: 'Google' },
        { href: 'https://youtube.com', text: 'YouTube' },
        { href: 'https://reddit.com', text: 'Reddit' },
    ];
```
- All statements should end with a `;`
- ES6 arrow functions should be used over traditional JavaScript functions where possible
- With regards to functions and classes, the opening curly brace (`{`) should be on the same line as the name of the class or function, and the closing curly brace (`}`) should be on the line following the last line of code in that class or function
- If an if statement and an else statement both have a single line of code each, then no curly braces should be used. However, if either the if statement or the else statement has multiple lines of code, curly braces should be used for both

## Note

This project does not include a mock API, so all responses received will be from a REST service, and not mock data.
