### Included packages

This project includes extra packages that are useful when starting a new React application, but are not included in the initial `create-react-app` project.

- `formik` - every web application uses forms. `formik` simplifies the process of working with HTML forms
- `react-router-dom` - the starter project comes with routing set up
- `styled-components` - allows for styling HTML elements without the need for external stylesheets
- `yup` - this package goes hand-in-hand with `formik` to provide a validation schema for HTML forms

If you don't want to use any of these packages, you can do `yarn remove <package-name>` to remove it.

### Additional packages that could be useful

- Font Awesome

  ```
  yarn add @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
  yarn add @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
  yarn add @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
  ```

- Bootstrap

  ```
  yarn add react-bootstrap
  ```

- Moment
  ```
  yarn add moment
  ```

### Additional features

- An API service and HTTP client for making API calls to a backend server
- Helper classes for storing and retrieving JWT tokens
- A user authentication helper class to determine the state of the user
- A constants file `const.js` for storing constants used throughout the application
- A theme file `theme.js` for theming

### Note

This project does not include a mock API, so all responses received will be from a REST service, and not mock data.
